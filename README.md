#### Creating Custom Strategies: ####
__Strategies are implemented in TradingStrats.py as functions and then referenced in Bot_Class.Bot.make_decision()__
* `Make_decision()` must return `Trade_Direction, stop_loss_val, take_profit_val` for the strategy to work properly
* You might draw inspiration for a strategy from one of the samples in __TradingStrats.py__  
Docs are being updated currently for the new bot

### Running the live trading bot ###
__Run strategies at your own risk I am not responsible for your trading decisions, futures are risky and proper risk management should be adhered to at all times, always have a stoploss__
```commandline
python3 live_trading.py
```
___
## Settings are in __live_trading_config.py__ ##
* Trade a single position at a time by setting `max_number_of_positions = 1`, to trade multiple coins just increment this value.
* `leverage` and `order_size` should be changed according to your preference
* `symbols_to_trade[]` is a list of the symbols you wish to trade, If you wish to trade all symbols set `trade_all_symbols = True`.
* __Trailing stop: set `use_trailing_stop = True` and change `trailing_stop_callback` to suit your strategy to use the trailing stop 
(Min val .001 i.e .1%, Max 5 i.e. 5%). The trailing stop will be placed when the take profit value margin of increase/decrease is reached from your strategy__.
* To close a trade based off a condition check_close_pos() must return a close_pos flag. (Not functioning currently, this needs updated for new bot)
* `trading_strategy` is the name of the strategy you want to use, see below for adding your own custom strategies.
* There are 11 default strategies to choose from: `StochRSIMACD, tripleEMAStochasticRSIATR, tripleEMA, breakout, stochBB, goldenCross,
candle_wick, fibMACD, EMA_cross, heikin_ashi_ema2 & heikin_ashi_ema`
* TP_SL_choice is the type of take profit and stop loss you want to use valid choices are: `USDT, %, x (ATR), x (Swing High/Low) level 1,
x (Swing High/Low) level 2, x (Swing High/Low) level 3, x (Swing Close) level 1, x (Swing Close) level 2, x (Swing Close) level 3`
* `SL_mult` and `TP_mult` are multipliers for the `TP_SL_choice`  
__Example:__  
TP_SL_choice = 'USDT'  
SL_mult = 1  
TP_mult = 2  
This configuration will set TP and SL values at $1 loss and $2 gain respectively  
* Choose the `interval` you want to trade, valid intervals are: `1m, 3m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 1d`.
